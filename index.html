            <p>Firstly, I know I called this "Our Journey," but it's from my POV. I hope you don't get bored haha. Oh btw you can play that song to put you in the mood ^^ Take your time reading this, alright?</p>
            <p>So, let me take you back to the year 2019...</p>
    
            <p>It all started one day in February 2019. I came across this super cool account on Anitwt. I always looked up to them because they were just so cool. Not only did they like the same anime as me, but they also liked the same ship? That was amazing. I loved their art so much and their art style was the cutest thing I've seen. That person is not just cool, but they were funny too. Of course, I wanted to get to know them more.</p>
    
            <p>I started commenting on their posts, complimenting their art, and trying to start conversations with them. My first few attempts? Let's just say they weren't very successful. Sometimes they'd reply, but other times they wouldn‚Äôt. Which was understandable since we didn‚Äôt know each other yet. Plus, they were pretty well-known on Anitwt and had way more friends than I did. But whenever they did reply, it makes me feel , <i>"Oh, not only is this person cool and talented, but they're super nice too."</i></p>
    
            <p>Oh they also made edits too, and honestly, I thought I might be a bit biased because I wanted to be their friend so badly but no, their edits were genuinely so good. I loved their song choices and how creative they are. It made me want to approach them even more. Well, time passed and we started getting closer through comments. Although, despite always commenting on each other's tweets, we rarely talked in private. That changed one day when I posted a tweet saying, "Like this tweet, and I'll tell you something in DMs."</p>
    
            <p>Well guess what? They liked the tweet! I took the chance to tell them how much I looked up to them, thought they were super nice, and wanted to be friends with them. <i>(It‚Äôs kinda embarrassing when I think about it now.)</i> To my surprise, they took it positively and said they wanted to be friends too. We started talking a lot, opening up to each other, and I even trauma-dumped on them. <i>(I still feel bad about that, you didn't deserve it. Sorry, bby.)</i> But honestly, ig that what brought us closer too. I can't thank them enough.</p>
    
            <p>Day by day, I found this person thoughtful, smart, kind, humble, and incredibly sweet. Without realizing I found myself already falling for them. My first intention was just to be friends, but somehow, it turned into more. I found myself smiling whenever I saw notifications from them, getting jealous when they got too friendly with others, and missing them when we didn't talk. I keep thinking about them even without realizing it. Hell I don't even know their name but just seeing or hearing the word purple makes me smile like I'm some sort of idiot.</p>
    
            <p>Eventually, I decided to show my feelings. Despite knowing where I stood and the risks, I started flirting with them seriously this time, not just platonically like we always did.  I mean we were already flirting with each other to begin with, like calling each other baby, love, platonic wife and shit. <i>(Very gay of us)</i> I guess that's one of the reason I'm brave to make a move, I know at the very least they don't hate me. So, I tried again, but this time, I wanted them to know I wasn't just being playful. I wanted them as my lover.</p>
    
            <p>Even though I flirted, I didn't confess outright. I wanted to be sure if they felt the same because I wasn't sure I could handle the rejection. I don't want to make it awkward between the two of us.  And tbh I feel like it was never casual between us to begin with. They made me an edit specially for me, they called me wife a lot even asking me to marry them on main. They also told me the wrote about me in their diary. Even other people start shipping us haha. <i>that was very iconic, I'm honoured.</i> I even told my friends about them too and they were super supportive.</p>
    
            <img src="mason.jpg" alt="Our Journey" class="small-image">
    
            <p>Fast forward to June 2019, I was dropping clear hints that I liked them, but  for some reason they still thought I was just being friendly. Well I can't blame them since I wasn‚Äôt even 100% sure they liked me back romantically. Finally, on the last day of Pride Month, I decided to confess. I told them how I felt, ready to face rejection if necessary. To my surprised, they told me they liked me too <b>romantically.</b> That was also the first time they ever told me their name, Laiba. It's such a beautiful name, and it's been my favorite ever since.</p>
    
            <p>Well it didn't stop there. We didn't define our relationship right away because we were both busy with exams. But we still stayed in touch.  I don't know if Laiba was ready to commit in a relationship yet so I held back. Knowing they love me too is already enough at that time. Status can wait. Even though I said status can wait, I still want to be in a relationship with them. It feels like I have no right to be sad or jealous because idk what we were. 
                I tried to ask Laiba out to be my gf a lot but I always held back because the time wasn't right.</p>

                <img src="confess2.jpg" alt="Our Journey" class="small-image">
<br>
               <p>However, on January 1st, I finally had the courage to ask Laiba to be my girlfriend. And guess what? They said yes! Starting the new year with my girlfriend felt amazing. Five years later, Laiba and I are still together, and I love them so much. A lot has happened these past few years, misunderstandings, happiness, longing but I always cherish every moment that we've shared. I also learnt a lot about Laiba. Laiba is really attractive. They have a beautiful smile, pretty eyes, angelic hair and I love how soft they sound when they talk to me. Not only that but they're intelligent, hardworking and always try their best in everything that they do. I'm so proud to see how far they grow since these past years.
                 I always think they're so cool, and very loving. I love how they always try to be there for me and make me feel loved but most of all I love them for who they are. </p>

                 <p>They always put up with me, no matter how messed up I am. I don't talk much with others, but when it comes to Laiba, I just can‚Äôt stop talking, and I‚Äôve never stopped being curious about them. I could talk to them for hours. Being with you makes me so happy, and I‚Äôm forever grateful for you, Laiba. I don‚Äôt know what the future holds for us or how things will end, but I hope you‚Äôll let me stay by your side as long as we can. Thank you for everything, Laiba. I love you. </p>
