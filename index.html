            <p>Firstly, I know I called this "Our Journey," but it's from my POV. I hope you don't get bored haha. Oh btw you can play that song to put you in the mood ^^ Take your time reading this, alright?</p>
            <p>So, let me take you back to the year 2019...</p>
    
            <p>It all started one day in February 2019. I came across this super cool account on Anitwt. I always looked up to them because they were just so cool. Not only did they like the same anime as me, but they also liked the same ship? That was amazing. I loved their art so much and their art style was the cutest thing I've seen. That person is not just cool, but they were funny too. Of course, I wanted to get to know them more.</p>
    
            <p>I started commenting on their posts, complimenting their art, and trying to start conversations with them. My first few attempts? Let's just say they weren't very successful. Sometimes they'd reply, but other times they wouldn‚Äôt. Which was understandable since we didn‚Äôt know each other yet. Plus, they were pretty well-known on Anitwt and had way more friends than I did. But whenever they did reply, it makes me feel , <i>"Oh, not only is this person cool and talented, but they're super nice too."</i></p>
    
            <p>Oh they also made edits too, and honestly, I thought I might be a bit biased because I wanted to be their friend so badly but no, their edits were genuinely so good. I loved their song choices and how creative they are. It made me want to approach them even more. Well, time passed and we started getting closer through comments. Although, despite always commenting on each other's tweets, we rarely talked in private. That changed one day when I posted a tweet saying, "Like this tweet, and I'll tell you something in DMs."</p>
    
            <p>Well guess what? They liked the tweet! I took the chance to tell them how much I looked up to them, thought they were super nice, and wanted to be friends with them. <i>(It‚Äôs kinda embarrassing when I think about it now.)</i> To my surprise, they took it positively and said they wanted to be friends too. We started talking a lot, opening up to each other, and I even trauma-dumped on them. <i>(I still feel bad about that, you didn't deserve it. Sorry, bby.)</i> But honestly, ig that what brought us closer too. I can't thank them enough.</p>
    
            <p>Day by day, I found this person thoughtful, smart, kind, humble, and incredibly sweet. Without realizing I found myself already falling for them. My first intention was just to be friends, but somehow, it turned into more. I found myself smiling whenever I saw notifications from them, getting jealous when they got too friendly with others, and missing them when we didn't talk. I keep thinking about them even without realizing it. Hell I don't even know their name but just seeing or hearing the word purple makes me smile like I'm some sort of idiot.</p>
    
            <p>Eventually, I decided to show my feelings. Despite knowing where I stood and the risks, I started flirting with them seriously this time, not just platonically like we always did.  I mean we were already flirting with each other to begin with, like calling each other baby, love, platonic wife and shit. <i>(Very gay of us)</i> I guess that's one of the reason I'm brave to make a move, I know at the very least they don't hate me. So, I tried again, but this time, I wanted them to know I wasn't just being playful. I wanted them as my lover.</p>
    
            <p>Even though I flirted, I didn't confess outright. I wanted to be sure if they felt the same because I wasn't sure I could handle the rejection. I don't want to make it awkward between the two of us.  And tbh I feel like it was never casual between us to begin with. They made me an edit specially for me, they called me wife a lot even asking me to marry them on main. They also told me the wrote about me in their diary. Even other people start shipping us haha. <i>that was very iconic, I'm honoured.</i> I even told my friends about them too and they were super supportive.</p>
    
            <img src="mason.jpg" alt="Our Journey" class="small-image">
    
            <p>Fast forward to June 2019, I was dropping clear hints that I liked them, but  for some reason they still thought I was just being friendly. Well I can't blame them since I wasn‚Äôt even 100% sure they liked me back romantically. Finally, on the last day of Pride Month, I decided to confess. I told them how I felt, ready to face rejection if necessary. To my surprised, they told me they liked me too <b>romantically.</b> That was also the first time they ever told me their name, Laiba. It's such a beautiful name, and it's been my favorite ever since.</p>
    
            <p>Well it didn't stop there. We didn't define our relationship right away because we were both busy with exams. But we still stayed in touch.  I don't know if Laiba was ready to commit in a relationship yet so I held back. Knowing they love me too is already enough at that time. Status can wait. Even though I said status can wait, I still want to be in a relationship with them. It feels like I have no right to be sad or jealous because idk what we were. 
                I tried to ask Laiba out to be my gf a lot but I always held back because the time wasn't right.</p>

                <img src="confess2.jpg" alt="Our Journey" class="small-image">
<br>
               <p>However, on January 1st, I finally had the courage to ask Laiba to be my girlfriend. And guess what? They said yes! Starting the new year with my girlfriend felt amazing. Five years later, Laiba and I are still together, and I love them so much. A lot has happened these past few years, misunderstandings, happiness, longing but I always cherish every moment that we've shared. I also learnt a lot about Laiba. Laiba is really attractive. They have a beautiful smile, pretty eyes, angelic hair and I love how soft they sound when they talk to me. Not only that but they're intelligent, hardworking and always try their best in everything that they do. I'm so proud to see how far they grow since these past years.
                 I always think they're so cool, and very loving. I love how they always try to be there for me and make me feel loved but most of all I love them for who they are. </p>

                 <p>They always put up with me, no matter how messed up I am. I don't talk much with others, but when it comes to Laiba, I just can‚Äôt stop talking, and I‚Äôve never stopped being curious about them. I could talk to them for hours. Being with you makes me so happy, and I‚Äôm forever grateful for you, Laiba. I don‚Äôt know what the future holds for us or how things will end, but I hope you‚Äôll let me stay by your side as long as we can. Thank you for everything, Laiba. I love you. </p>

        <P>If you remember, I used to make a Canva presentation for your birthday, but somehow it's just gone? But if you do remember it, I used to write this kind of stuff there too. </P>
        <h2> I miss you everyday </h2>
        <p>At first, I thought it was weird to miss you every day, especially since we've never met irl. As surprising as it may seem, I'm not usually someone who's clingy or constantly needs company. I rarely reach out first, and I don't often get excited when someone texts me. But I guess that doesn't apply to you.  
            Sometimes, even seconds after we talk, I somehow still miss you. I think about you every day. Ik I don't always show it, but once in a while when I want some encouragement, I'll let you know that I miss you. Even rn, I'm still surprised by how I act when it comes to you.  
            I don't know if it's normal to feel this way, but I do miss you every single day. I always cherish the times we talk, and every moment we spend together.</p>
        <br>
    <h2> Things that reminds me of you </h2>
    <p>I guess this is one of the reasons why I keep of thinking you.</p>
    <br>
    <b><p>The color purple</p></b>
                <img src="purple.jpg" alt="Purple" class="small-image">
            <p>Of course you already know this, and for the obvious reason too. Although I know it's not your favorite color, I still think of you whenever I saw something purple or when someone mentioned about the color. Oh that reminds me, I think I never asked but why do you choose the name purple as your dn?</p>
    <br>
    <b><p>The songs that I listen to</p></b>
    <img src="playlist.jpeg" alt="Playlist" class="small-image">
    <p>I love that we made each other playlist that reminds us of each other. I love that we even made a shared playlist together. Naturally, the playlists will reminds me of you. However, it does not restricted to that. Every songs that I listen to, even not from the playlists, always makes me think of you. The sudden smile that appears while listening to those songs, ig I must look crazy to other people haha I listen to songs everyday so ig that explain why not a single day i stop thinking about you.
    </p>
    <br>
    <b><p>Kiribaku, Haikaveh, Mitsuaya Etc.</p></b>
    <img src="kiribaku.jfif" alt="kiribaku" class="small-image">
    <p>Basically all the ships that you like? hahah to be honest I started liking some of those ships because of you. I know you like them and I also know you have a great taste ;D heavy on kiribaku tho, even though we don't really like them as much or talk about them nowadays, nothing would make me forget about the thing that made us found each other.</p>
    <br>
    <b><p>My Guitar</p></b>
    <img src="guitar.jfif" alt="Guitar" class="small-image">
    <p> Did not find any of my guitar pic but one them look like this aa anyway do you know, I used to lose interest in playing the guitar. I was really passionate about it back when I was 16, as time goes by I rarely play it anymore because I don't know who or why do I even play for. I used to write a song for you, ig it was around the time we started going out. It was really embarrassing, the lyrics are just so?? yeah idk how to describe it but it was not my best ones.
    but despite all i guess you're the reason why I started playing again back then and the reason that motivates me to keep on playing too. </p>
    <br>
    <b><p>Pretty Places</p></b>
    <img src="sunset.jpg" alt="senset" class="small-image">
    <p> I always think of you whenever I go to somewhere pretty, I always think 'it would be nice if they could see this with me rn'. I want to go to all the places with you and have you beside me. I think you would like it too.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2> Things I like about you </h2>
    <p>Please you already know how much I like you and I also have mentioned them in your previous birthday gifts. How I mentioned about your pretty eyes or your caring personality and how smart my gf is. So, I won't repeat that. I like that you always notice the small things about me. Even when I don't say anything, if something's bothering me, you somehow still reach out. You always try to be there for me.You might not be as loud as me when it comes to showing your feelings, but I still do noticed it. 
        and I find it cute too. I like how you always think of me, how considerate you are, and how you treat me like I'm someone so precious to you. I find it really endearing. </p>
        <p>I also like how you always pampered me haha you always go along with every things I suggest. I like your personality so much. like how you joke around with your friends, your funny tweets, how cool and reliable you can be. Also, the way that you don't like the club works but still do your best, i like how ambitious are you. 
        I really like your mindset and opinions too. You're mature and good at expressing the things you want to say. Sometimes I feel like I know so much about you, and other times it feels like I've barely scratched the surface.  
        And it's kinda crazy how I've fallen for all these things about you even though there's still so much I don't know. If we had the chance, I would love to know more about you and keep on loving you.</p>
        <br>
    <h2> About us </h2>
    <p>If I'm being honest, there's a lot of emotions that I've felt over the years when it comes to us, happiness, sadness, jealousy, envy, longing, insecure, desire, frustration, but most of all I feel <b>loved.</b> I know we don't talk everday. I know we don't do video calls or calls like other couples, I know we never have a serious plan to meet each other despite being in relationship for 5 years, 
        and I know we tends to keep everything to ourselves because we don't want the other to get hurt too. But I want you to know that I don't care any of that. The only thing I care about is <b>you.</b> I want to know how you feel, I want to know what you want me to do, what could i do for you. I want to know about your feelings too. I love how considerate you are towards me but I want you to know it's ok to talk to me about your feelings and desires.
        you're not alone bby, I love you sm. I'm sorry if at any point over the past five years, I hurt you or made you feel like you couldn't talk to me. And if I ever do something that you don't like please let me know, you have every right to. I want to take care of you for as long as I could, and I want you to be the one who take care of me for as long as you could too. We'll make it worth every second. I love you, laiba.‚ù§Ô∏è
